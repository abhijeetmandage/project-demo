This mini project is a Java-based desktop application developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL for database management. It features a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and log out, with user data efficiently stored and retrieved using JDBC (MySQL Connector/J).

In addition to authentication, the application provides an interactive module for drawing and visualizing Bézier curves of any order by dynamically defining control points. The curves are rendered smoothly with proper event handling, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

The project also includes full Notepad functionality, allowing users to create, edit, and save text files within the same application. Overall, this mini project demonstrates practical implementation of Java OOP principles, GUI programming, database connectivity, and file handling, making it a complete and functional desktop utility application suitable for understanding real-world Java development.
