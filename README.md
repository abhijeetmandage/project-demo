This mini project is a Java-based desktop application developed using Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL for database management. The application provides a user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and log out securely.

The project uses JDBC (MySQL Connector/J) to establish a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of user data. The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, with proper event handling and validation.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Java OOP concepts, GUI programming, and database connectivity, making it suitable as a foundational mini project for understanding real-world Java applications.
